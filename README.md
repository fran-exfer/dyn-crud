# Dyn CRUD

A simple CRUD application made with React and built with Material-UI. It's powered by a Node.js/Express API that connects to a MongoDB server. This is a test practice project. Users are just a demo data type that is believable in a real app. You can filter them by username, full name, email or address. This was not a limitation, but an arbitrary choice.

This CRUD app doesn't perform ANY kind of validation, as it was made in a couple of days just for practising purposes. It's nowhere finished in this respect, so if you're using the code to learn, have this in mind.

## Getting started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
